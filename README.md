# assembly_line_shortestpath
Built by Daniel and Kimberly Wang
Free for personal and commercial use, but please ask for permission. 

An assembly line is being built. The user inputs the start and end points of the factory layout and the factory layoutâ€™s dimensions. 
The goal is to find the shortest path that minimizes the amount of conveyors being used in the system and saves money for the company.
Python code: uses BFS and greedy choice algorithm to find the shortest path and place the equipment into the line. 
Enjoy it :)
